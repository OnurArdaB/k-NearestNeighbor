# Brute Force kNN
 This is a basic implementation of brute-force kNN which was developed for fun.
 
 Sample case can be enhanced by using LDA since images are data instances with large number of features.
 Class is very lightweight and does not contain any performance metric. Only the Minkowski and 
 Eucledian Distance metrics are implemented.
