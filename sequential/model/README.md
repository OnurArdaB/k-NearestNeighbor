# Brute-Force KNN 

Author: Onur Arda Bodur

This is a basic implementation of k-Nearast Neigbors Classifier which uses brute-force search. It has both Minkowski and Euclidean Distance.
Development dataset was FASHION MNIST with no pre-processing module implemented in kNN class. Users must give pre-processed data to system or else the
class could not handle the task very well. There exists a sample folder which contains an executable that uses kNN class and manages to acquire good results
with respect to the test data. 

Future Work:

[] Add more distance metrics
[] Multi-Threading for Nearest Neighbor detection
[] Add different algorithms to compute the nearest neighbor
[] Performance Metrics inside the class
